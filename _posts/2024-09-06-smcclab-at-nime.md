Researchers from the SMCClab presented a number of works at the 2024 International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression in Utrecht.

- Sandy Ma and Yichen Wang performed [_Unspoken_ a mixed-reality musical performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5AdOE8QnKk) exploring the potential of augmented reality technology to support collaborative performance practice.
- Charles presented a full-day workshop [Building NIMEs with Embedded AI](https://smcclab.github.io/nime-embedded-ai/) along with Teresa Pelinski of C4DM at Queen Mary University of London.
- Sandy presented her Honours project _Touching Wires_ as a work in progress.
- Charles presented the IMPSY project as a work in progress.

Perhaps most importantly, we announced that [NIME2025 will take place at ANU in Canberra](https://nime2025.org)! We're looking forward to hosting NIME and bringing the world of NIME research to our home institution!
