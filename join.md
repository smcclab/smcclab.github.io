The SMCClab is always on the look out for talented PhD students. Check out our [students page here](http://charlesmartin.au/students/).

Competitive PhD applicants should be interested in one of the research areas on our home page, must have experience in computing and computer music (or another creative technology field), and should have completed (or close to completing) a Master or Bachelor with Honours with excellent results that included a significant research component.

SMCClab students generally publish in interdisciplinary areas of computer music, human computer interaction, and computational intelligence. In general this means that we particularly look for students with experience publishing or participating in [NIME](https://nime.org) or other computer music conferences such as [SMC](https://smcnetwork.org), [Audio Mostly](https://audiomostly.com), [ICMC](https://www.computermusic.org), and [CHI or other SIGCHI conferences](https://sigchi.org).

Applicants for Master or honours projects at ANU should look at available projects on the [School of Computing website](https://comp.anu.edu.au/study/projects/) (select "Sound, Music, and Creative Computing Lab" under "Research Group").
