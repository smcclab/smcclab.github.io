Welcome to the Sound, Music, and Creative Computing Lab at the Australian National University.

![]({% link assets/smcclab-title-slide.jpg %})

- We are based at the [ANU School of Computing](https://comp.anu.edu.au)
- [Dr Charles Martin](https://charlesmartin.au) is the lead researcher.

Our lab aims to develop **new musical instruments** that sense and understand music, actively **assisting musicians** during performances. We apply **computational intelligence**, **AR/VR**, and **sonic interaction design** in creative contexts. We explore how creative computing can inform studies of collaboration, spatial interaction, and decision making.

Members of the SMCClab are:

- [Dr Charles Martin](https://charlesmartin.au) (**lead researcher**).
- [Minsik Choi](https://yorkcla.github.io) (PhD researcher)
- [Xinlei Niu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xinlei-niu-544ab6216/) (PhD researcher)
- [Yichen Wang](https://yichenwangs.github.io) (PhD researcher)

SMCClab members are involved in teaching several courses at the ANU, including [Sound and Music Computing (COMP4350/8350)](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/laptop-ensemble), [Art and Interaction Computing (COMP1720/6720)](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720) and [ANU Creative Computing Extension](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/extn1019/).

# Join us!

The SMCClab is always on the look out for talented PhD students. Check out our [students page here](http://charlesmartin.au/students/).

Competitive PhD applicants should be interested in one of the research areas below, must have experience in computing and computer music (or another creative technology field), and should have completed (or close to completing) a Master or 
Bachelor with Honours with excellent results that included a significant research component.

Applicants for Master or honours projects at ANU should look at available projects on the [School of Computing website](https://comp.anu.edu.au/study/projects/) (select "Sound, Music, and Creative Computing Lab" under "Research Group").

# Research Areas

## Collaborative Interfaces

![]({% link assets/collaboration.jpg %})

This research aims to create new ways for groups to make music together. We created **touchscreen musical instruments** that communicate interactions over a network.  These instruments engage music performers in new kinds of **ensemble interaction**. 

## Spatial Interaction

We create **authentic spatial musical apps** that support interaction in AR/VR computers. We experimented with new **freehand gestures** in AR and have deployed a spiral-shaped keyboard in collaborative music experiments as well as artistic performances.

## Generative Sound

AI-generated sound could change the way we make sounds and create music. We have developed a new approach to **singing-voice synthesis** focussed on more **accurate duration predictions**, enabling end-to-end training. We are now looking at novel **text-to-sound** generation models.

## Intelligent Interfaces

Intelligent instruments predict human musical interactions to help them create music. We model **embodied musical interactions**, or the movements of human performers. Our prototypes include **EMPI**, a portable musical robot that responds to performances with a 1-dimensional musical interface.
