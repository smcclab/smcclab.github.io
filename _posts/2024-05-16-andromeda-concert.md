A 60-minute performance of new music for new AI musical instruments featuring Alec Hunter, Charles Martin, Yichen Wang and Sandy Ma.
 
Andromeda is Coming is the improvised music project of Charles Martin and Alec Hunter dedicated to exploring new sounds and music making technologies in long-form musical performances.
 
For this performance, Andromeda adopt artificial intelligence and augmented reality musical instruments from the ANU Sound, Music and Creative Computing Lab. These include Charles Martin’s IMPSY system for building intelligent musical instruments and Yichen Wang’s “Cubing Sound” augmented reality musical instrument. These new musical instruments will be reflected by real-time interactive visualisation.
We ask what new sounds and new music might be created with these new technologies, and what AI and virtual musical performances will look like?
