The first of our smcclablive concerts was held at the Peter Karmel Building Big Band Room on 7 November 2025. Works were presented from researchers and students in the ANU SMCClab with guests Charlie Roberts from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (USA) and Ben Swift from the ANU School of Cybernetics.

The video from our concert is available [here (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/S_JuZUTmwbk) and below.

It was a great evening with a busy audience of interested folks at the intersections of art, music, and computing in Canberra.

We plan to run smcclablive as an end-of-semester event every six months featuring visiting artists and researchers from Australia and around the world.
