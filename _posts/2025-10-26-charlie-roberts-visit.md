title:  Live Coder and Researcher Charlie Roberts's Visit
---

We have our colleague [Charlie Roberts](https://charlie-roberts.com/) visiting us from the states!

Charlie will be around campus throughout the week and throw out a [show]({% link _posts/2025-10-27-smcclablive-1.md %}) to wrap up his grand visit, joined by other SMCClab artists and friends.

Here is the visit schedule, in case you want to join any of these events to learn more about live coding music, programming language and many more...
