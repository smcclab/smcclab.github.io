SMCClablive #1 is the first in the ANU Sound, Music, and Creative Computing
Lab's research performance series featuring new instruments, new sounds, and
new artistic experiences on stage.

This time we feature [Charlie Roberts (USA)](https://charlie-roberts.com/),
visiting artist and researcher as well as live coder and computer music
performer. Charlie's research examines programming languages, environments and
libraries in digital arts practice and he is well known as the creator of the
Gibber creative coding environment used in teaching computational media around
the world including at ANU.

Joining Charlie on stage will be performers from the ANU SMCClab including
[Charles Martin](https://charlesmartin.au), [Yichen
Wang](https://www.yichenwang.io/), [Sandy Ma](https://snud.me/), as well as
[Ben Swift](https://benswift.me/) from the ANU School of Cybernetics presenting
their computational arts research practices in performance. We will also
feature [ANU computing](https://comp.anu.edu.au) project students from this
semester, Suhani Narang and Yijia Wang.

Join us for this evening of experimental computer music making!
