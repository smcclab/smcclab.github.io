The SMCClab is always on the look out for talented PhD students. Check out our [students page here](http://charlesmartin.au/students/).

Competitive PhD applicants should be interested in one of the research areas on our home page, must have experience in computing and computer music (or another creative technology field), and should have completed (or close to completing) a Master or 
Bachelor with Honours with excellent results that included a significant research component.

Applicants for Master or honours projects at ANU should look at available projects on the [School of Computing website](https://comp.anu.edu.au/study/projects/) (select "Sound, Music, and Creative Computing Lab" under "Research Group").
